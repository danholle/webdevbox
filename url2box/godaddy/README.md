*Using nginx and SSL to create a secure window into your dev box*

--------

By the end of this step, you will have a secure interface
between your dev machine and the public internet which 
exposes only the things you want to expose.

Sub-steps are
 1. Set up your domain on GoDaddy
 2. Direct HTTP and HTTPS traffic for that domain to your home internet service to your dev server
 3. Set up automatic updating to associate your home IP address to your domain
 4. Install nginx to direct inbound traffic to your static HTML and Tomcat
